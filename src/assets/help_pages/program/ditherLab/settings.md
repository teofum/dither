# DitherLab Settings


## Source Image

In this section you can open an image from your computer to dither and see a preview thumbnail, as well as some basic source image metadata such as resolution and file size.

## Resize

In this section you can set resizing behavior as well as a target size. The final size of the rendered image is determined as:

* Keep original size: The image is rendered at its original size. No resizing is done.
* Resize to fit: The image is resized to fit within the specified size, while conserving its original aspect ratio. This mode will not scale the image up.
* Force resize: The image is resized to the specified size, and may be scaled up or stretched.

## Color Palette

In this section, you can select a color palette to use when dithering. Palettes are divided into groups, selected with the first dropdown menu. The second dropdown menu selects palettes within the group.

From this section you can also click [Palette Editor] to open the custom palette editor. For more details, see [Custom palettes](help/programs/dlab/settings/palettes).

## Process

In this section you can select a render device and the dithering process to run. For more details on render devices, processes, and a breakdown of each process' settings, see [Processes](help/programs/dlab/process).
