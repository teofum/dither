# About DitherOS

DitherOS is a web application designed to resemble the desktop environments of the 1990s to early 2000s. While its primary feature and namesake is the dithering engine DitherLab, DitherOS runs several programs [not yet -- it's very early in development].

## Why?

Because, well, why not. DitherOS is a side project for fun and practice that essentially acts as a sandbox for whatever silly things I might want to put online.

And because I find explaining things almost as much fun as making things, these pages will often contain detailed explanations on how the different parts of DitherOS work. Of course, DitherOS is also an open source project, so if you're really curious you can always [take a look](https://github.com/teofum/dither).
