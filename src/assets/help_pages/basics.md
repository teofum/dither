# DitherOS Basics

DitherOS does everything with windows, much like a real desktop environment. Each program runs within its own window, allowing multiple instances of the same program to run at the same time.

## Starting programs

Programs are started from the Program Manager, a launcher application. To start the Program Manager after closing it, click the [Program Manager] button on the desktop, found in the top left corner.

## Manipulating windows

All windows can be moved and closed. Most windows can also be resized and maximized. Window manipulation may be restricted on some windows that have a fixed size.

### Moving and resizing windows

To move a window, simply drag from anywhere on the title bar. To resize a window, drag starting from its border. The cursor will change to [â†”] dual arrows when the window can be resized by dragging, and the direction of the arrows indicates the direction of resizing.  
Drag from the corners to change the width and height of a window at the same time.

### Maxmizing and closing windows

Windows can be maximized to take up the entire screen by clicking on the maximize button at the top right corner or double-clicking anywhere on the title bar. The same action will restore a maximized window to its original size.  
Windows can be closed by clicking the [x] close button at the top right corner of the title bar. Be aware that closing a window will terminate the program running in it and the program state will be lost.
